# Learn to Code Interim

### Schedule

**Monday and Tuesday**

We will meet at 8:30 AM in a location to be determined, either the library
computer lab or the Middlefield lab. The day will conclude at 3:00PM. I will
probably stay late to help students with various projects or ideas


**Wednesday**

On Wednesday we will take BART into San Francisco and walk to two startup
companies' offices in SOMA. Students will meet at Walnut Creek BART at 8am. We
will take BART to Embarcadero and Afterwards we will eat lunch and head back to
Walnut Creek on BART, no later than 2:30PM.


### Equipment

Students are encouraged to bring and use their own laptops, if they have them.
This way, any work that's done during the interim can continue to be used and
improved after Interim. School provided computers will be available and they
are completely suitable for the interim curriculum.

All operating systems (Mac, PC, Linux) are suitable. Students using their own
laptops are encouraged to install the following free programs before the start
of Interim:

- [Python 2.7](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download)
- A [text editor][editor]. I recommend [Notepad++][notepad] for PC and
  [TextWrangler][wrangler] for Mac. Linux users can use [gedit][gedit].
- A modern web browser such as [Firefox][firefox] or [Google Chrome][chrome]
- A client for uploading files to a web server, such as [FileZilla Client][filezilla].

### BART Notes

- We are responsible for the safety and oversight of the students on the field
trip on Wednesday. Unfortunately this means students must meet us at Walnut
Creek BART on Wednesday morning.
- Note that if you are parking at the Walnut Creek station, the lot tends to
fill up by 7:40 AM.
- Andrew and I will distribute BART tickets to students on Wednesday; do not
worry about purchasing your own ticket.
- Students should bring a bag lunch, or money for lunch on Wednesday. Lunch
should not exceed $12 on Wednesday. Alternately the school cafeteria will be
open and lunch can be purchased there.
